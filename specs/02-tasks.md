# Project Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize version control repository
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure code quality tools (linters, formatters)
- [ ] Set up testing framework

## 2. Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Functionality

| ID | Task | Owner | Priority | Status | Estimate | Notes |
|----|------|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| T1-01 | [Task description] | [Owner] | High | Not Started | [X] days | [Dependencies] |
| T1-02 | [Task description] | [Owner] | Medium | Not Started | [X] days | |

### Phase 2: Additional Features

| ID | Task | Owner | Priority | Status | Estimate | Notes |
|----|------|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| T2-01 | [Task description] | [Owner] | Medium | Not Started | [X] days | |

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization

| ID | Task | Owner | Priority | Status | Estimate | Notes |
|----|------|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| T3-01 | [Task description] | [Owner] | Low | Not Started | [X] days | |

## 3. Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Status | Deliverables |
|-----------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Project Kickoff | YYYY-MM-DD | Pending | Project charter, Initial planning |
| MVP Complete | YYYY-MM-DD | Pending | Core functionality working |
| Beta Release | YYYY-MM-DD | Pending | Feature complete, testing phase |
| Production Launch | YYYY-MM-DD | Pending | Production deployment |

## 4. Dependencies

These are any external or internal factors your project relies on.

**External Dependencies**: e.g., third-party APIs, DNS setups, SSL cert issuance, 
or even waiting on a designer's UI mockups.

**Internal Dependencies**: e.g., completing database migrations before starting 
endpoint implementation, or setting up CI before adding test workflows.

**Impact & Status**: Helps highlight bottlenecks early. A “High impact” pending 
task could delay entire features.

| ID | Dependency | Type | Owner | Status | Impact |
|----|------------|------|-------|--------|--------|
| D1 | [Dependency name] | External/Internal | [Owner] | Pending | High/Medium/Low |

## 5. Risk Assessment

This identifies potential threats to your timeline, security, or functionality—then 
sets a plan to handle them.

**Probability**: How likely it is to happen (e.g., “High” for Bun breaking semver 
compatibility).

**Impact**: What damage it would cause (e.g., “High” if a failed migration corrupts 
production data).

**Mitigation**: Your defense strategy. Like using bun.lockb and Docker for r
eproducibility, or dry-run migrations before deployment.

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| [Risk description] | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | [Mitigation steps] | [Owner] |

## 6. Resource Allocation

This maps who’s doing what, when, and how much effort it takes.

**Role & Name**: Backend Dev, DevOps, QA, etc. In a solo setup, you're probably 
all three!

**Allocation %**: If someone’s working part-time (e.g. “60% on this project during 
August”), you can plan more realistically.

**Time Period & Notes**: Track when folks are available and if anything might affect 
bandwidth (like “on-call for another team this sprint”).

| Resource | Role | Allocation (%) | Time Period | Notes |
|----------|------|----------------|--------------|-------|
| [Name/Role] | [Role] | XX% | MM/YYYY - MM/YYYY | [Notes] |
